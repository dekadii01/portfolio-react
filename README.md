# Welcome to My Personal Website

Welcome to the latest version of my personal website. In this update, I have switched to using React.js because I've recently developed an interest in React JS. I designed this website with a more dynamic and responsive interface. Additionally, I have implemented the concept of components and props, which makes the development and maintenance of the site more efficient.

## Key Features

- **Built with React.js**: Utilizing modern technology for a more dynamic and responsive interface.
- **Component and Props Concept**: Simplifying site management and development with a more modular and efficient structure.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized display across various devices, both desktop and mobile.

## Tech Stack

1. **React JS**: For building the user interface.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: For flexible and easily customizable design and styling.
3. **Flowbite (components)**: For ready-to-use interface components that are easy to integrate.
4. **Vite**: For modern, fast tooling in React project development.
5. **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: For interactive animations as users scroll through the page.
